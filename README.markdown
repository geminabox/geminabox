## Really simple rubygem hosting

Gem in a box is a simple [sinatra][sinatra] app to allow you to host your own in-house gems.

It has no security, or authentication so you should handle this yourself.

## Server Setup

    gem install geminabox

Create a config.ru as follows:

    require "rubygems"
    require "geminabox"

    Geminabox.data = "/var/geminabox-data" # â€¦or wherever
    run Geminabox

And finally, hook up the config.ru as you normally would ([passenger][passenger], [thin][thin], [unicorn][unicorn], whatever floats your boat).

## Legacy RubyGems index

RubyGems supports generating indexes for the so called legacy verions (< 1.2), and since it is very rare to use such versions nowadays, it can be disabled, thus improving indexing times for large repositories. If it's safe for your application, you can disable support for these legacy versions by adding the following configuration to yout config.ru file:

    Geminabox.build_legacy = false

## Client Usage

    gem install geminabox

    gem inabox pkg/my-awesome-gem-1.0.gem

Simples!
